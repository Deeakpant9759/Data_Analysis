What do you notice? Almost all the super-popular videos—the ones that everyone’s watching—are really short, like a couple of minutes or even less. In fact, you can see a big bunch of dots on the left, and that spot is where all the viral, super-watched videos are.

But as you look at longer videos, way over on the right, hardly anyone’s watching them. They’re just not getting those huge view numbers.

There's a red line on the chart too, which shows the overall trend: the longer your video, the fewer people are likely to watch it. So if you’re dreaming of making a video that everyone sees, your best bet is to keep it short and snappy.

That’s the story this chart tells us: **People love quick videos. The longer it drags on, the more likely they are to skip it.** So, if you want to go viral, make it short and sweet!"

**"Average Watch Duration vs Video Duration"**

"So here's what's happening with this chart - it's showing us something really interesting about how people watch videos.

Each blue dot is a video, and what we're seeing is: **the longer a video is, the longer people actually stick around to watch it.**

Look at the short videos on the left - people might only watch for 10-50 seconds before clicking away. But for longer videos, people are willing to watch for 100, 150, even 200+ seconds.

The red line going upward shows this trend clearly - **longer videos keep people engaged for longer periods.**

This is actually surprising because you'd think people would get bored with long videos. But what this chart is telling us is that if someone clicks on a longer video, they're probably more committed to watching it through.

So the story here is: **If you make a longer video and people choose to watch it, they're likely to stick around and actually watch more of it.** It's like they're making a bigger commitment when they decide to start a longer video."

**“Average CTR Over Time”**

"This line chart shows how the average CTR (Click-Through Rate) changed over the months in 2025. The CTR tells us, out of everyone who saw your video thumbnail or link, how many actually clicked to watch it.

Looking at the chart, the points go up and down but mostly stay between 4% and 9%. Sometimes, there are bigger jumps or drops, but overall, things seem pretty steady with ups and downs, like a heartbeat.

The main story is—your average CTR didn’t stay flat or completely steady, but it always stayed in a healthy range. People kept clicking on your content steadily throughout the year, though some weeks or months did a little better or worse than others. There aren’t any huge crashes or sky-high spikes that lasted.

So, you can say your content has kept viewers interested all year, with a solid and reliable CTR!”

# Final Summary
### **Insights for SciAstra Team**

The analysis of video performance in 2025 reveals several clear trends. **Short videos dominate in views**, with the highest-performing content typically under a few minutes. This indicates that the audience prefers quick, digestible content for rapid engagement. Conversely, longer videos receive fewer views overall, but those who do watch tend to stay engaged longer, suggesting a **committed audience segment** for in-depth material. Average watch duration increases with video length, showing that while short videos attract more clicks, long videos retain attentive viewers. CTR has remained steady between 4–9%, indicating consistent audience interest and reliable thumbnail/content appeal.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

1. Focus on producing **short, high-impact videos** to maximize reach and virality.
    
2. Maintain a **mix of longer videos** to engage highly committed viewers and build deeper learning content.
    
3. Optimize thumbnails and titles further to improve CTR consistency and capitalize on viewer attention.
    

**Interesting Patterns:**

- Top 5 videos are predominantly short, confirming viral trends.
    
- Bottom 5 videos are mostly longer, reinforcing that audience engagement drops with video length unless the content is highly compelling.
    
- Engagement metrics show a clear dichotomy: **short videos drive views**, long videos drive **retention**.
